Change numbers

    Change numbers are one of the core concepts of ICM. They are used to sort resources, thereby ensuring
    that they become installed in the proper order.

# The default

    Out of the box, ICM supports change numbers, like <<0.2.0>>, or <<2345.6789.3>>. More formally, a change number must have the format
    <<<N1.N2.N3...>>>, where N1, N2, N3, etc. are an unlimited sequence of integer numbers. Trailing zeroes are ignored: ICM does not
    distinguish between <<0.2>>, and <<0.2.0>>. Classifiers like <<alpha>>, <<SNAPSHOT>>, or <<GA>> are unsupported.

    If you create an ICM instance like this:

+----------------------------------
    Icm<IcmChangeNumber> = Icm.builder()
                         . ...  // Invoke configuration methods on the builder
                         .build();
+----------------------------------

    then this default implementation is what you get.

# Alternative implementations

    If you would like to have other version numbers (may be, because qualifiers like "alpha", or "beta", are soooo important to you :-),
    you must prepare the following:

    1.) A change number class, which is intended to replace IcmChangeNumber. This is basically a POJO.
    2.) A so-called {{{../apidocs/com/github/jochenw/icm/core/api/IcmChangeNumberHandler.html}change number handler}}. This is, what
        ICM needs to interact with your POJOS. Mainly, it provides the ability to convert strings into change numbers, and vice versa.
        Additionally, it can compare change numbers: This is required for sorting.

    If you have these classes, then you can use them to create an ICM instance as follows:

+----------------------------------
    Icm<MyChangeNumber> = Icm.builder(MyChangeNumber.class, new MyChangeNumberHandler())
                         . ...  // Invoke configuration methods on the builder
                         .build();
+----------------------------------

    Note, that this is basically just the same than using the default change numbers, except that you create the IcmBuilder in a slightly
    different manner.
